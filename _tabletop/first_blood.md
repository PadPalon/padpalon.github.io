Buy one line of miniatures, use them for two very different games? Sign me up! This is
the skirmish sized sibling to Last Argument Of Kings, and I think it is great! My usual
TLAOK group is not really interested in First Blood, and my other friends are only just
starting to get their warbands together, so I don't have many chances to play currently.

The rules are free, so if you're interested, check them out [here](https://www.para-bellum.com/rules-and-faq/).
