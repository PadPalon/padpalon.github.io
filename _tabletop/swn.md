The second game I play, although even less frequently, is Stars Without Number, an OSR-adjacent
sci-fi game. It's made by Kevin Crawford, who does a lot of super cool things, including
multiple other *Thing* Without Numbers system. Check him out! He has lite versions of most of his rules
available for free on [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/sine-nomine-publishing?sortBy=lowestPrice)

Shoutout to the Swan Song campaign on YouTube that got me interested in the system. Beware though,
some people in that campaign are horrible or just difficult people, but there's also Steven Lumpkin,
who might be one of my favourite people in the space.
