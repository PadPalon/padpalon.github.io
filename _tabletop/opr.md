If you are interested in tabletop strategy games, but were always scared off by the rule systems,
[check this out](https://www.onepagerules.com/)! Free rules you can learn in a few minutes, and get playing
with whatever minis you have laying around! There's different systems for all kinds of game sizes. 
It's almost too good to believe.

Go look at them, and if you like them, why not give them some support? I think projects like this need
to be supported!

Also, apparently they have started writing short stories and more lore for their universes?
I literally just saw this as I was writing this text, so I'm excited to dive into this as well!
