I got into this Rank & File fantasy game by complete accident. A friend of a friend of my then-girlfriend-now-wife
happened to be a Community Vanguard of Para Bellum and organized a tryout session at our local game store, just as
they released the City States faction, which are kinda gearpunk ancient greeks, with beautiful artwork, and suddenly
I had a box of them at home.

It is a super fun game, but I don't play enough to really get the rather expansive ruleset into my brain, so it's
also still quite stressful to play. The rules are free, so if you are intererested, check them out [here](https://www.para-bellum.com/rules-and-faq/).

I currently own enough minis to make about 1 1/2 City States lists, so I don't have much choice during list building,
but we're getting there! I'd say about 3/4 are even painted!
