As with so many people, Dungeons & Dragons was my first introduction into all things tabletop.

I'm currently in a long-running campaign with some friends where I play Torunn Skybreak,
a swashbuckling and fast-talking bard, who is also this worlds equivalent of a wrestling superstar. Usually
we play about once a month, but scheduling is hard, because being an adult sucks.

I have some very vague memories of hearing about it when I was a small child and trying to "play"
by just writing down whatever stats and imagining stories. I don't remember using dice or anything.
Or playing with someone else, I think I just did it to entertain myself. I should ask my parents
if they remember anything about that, could make for a fun story.

Later, I started watching internet personalities play actual D&D with some oldschool VTT, using terrible voice chat and
streamed in horrible quality. And it was the shit. Shout out to TheSpoonyOne and his Dethklok campaign!
Being a teenager then, I of course had to replicate what I saw, and asked / convinced / forcibly drafted
some friends.
