This is a skirmish sized game in the Grimdark Future universe. I've played several games
with friends, and it's excellent. We had several people go from not knowing a thing
about the rules, to playing their first games and having fun in maybe 15 or 30 minutes.

You control single miniatures or very small units in alternating activations. Each activation
is mostly just one of four actions. Attacking and defending is a single roll each.
1s always fail, 6s always succeed. It's all so elegant and easy, and it's fun!
