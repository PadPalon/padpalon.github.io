I've been working at a software company called **Tocco AG** since August of 2011.
I've started as an intern and have stuck around since then. Moving from simple configuration
tasks to more intricate Java programming, I now work in many different areas of our product.
You can find us on our [website](https://www.tocco.ch/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tocco/).
We also have some of our code available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/toccoag).
