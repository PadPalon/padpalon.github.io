In 2017 I've started studying computer sciences part-time at the **Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandete Wissenschaften**
([ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch)) in Winterthur. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2021. You
can find my bachelor project on guitar stem extraction from mixed songs on [GitHub](https://github.com/splitstrument).
