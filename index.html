        <h2>Welcome to my virtual home</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Luca Neukom, although I go by the handle PadPalon or MellowMelon on the internet.

            This page will serve me as an outlet for information on some of my projects. You can find a complete list
            of things I have worked on at my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/padpalon">Soundcloud</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/PadPalon">GitHub</a> pages. On here I will only publish the things I find to
            actually have some value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The page itself is running with nothing but some HTML and CSS from <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
            Since I've never been any good at designing websites and have never liked the idea of using pre-built
            templates,
            this page will probably remain pretty plain. But it should serve its purpose.
