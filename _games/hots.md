I like Heroes Of The Storm. Like, a lot. It's the first game where I really got into the
esports scene and wanted to improve my gameplay to a more advanced level. Watching streams and
tutorials, practicing mechanics, learning strategy, all that jazz.

The logical conclusion of course was to start a amateur team to play with. And so my team
5 For Silver in Heroes Lounge came to
fruition. It is by far one of the most fun and intense gaming experience I've ever had. While
I did all the captain work from Season 2 until Season 7, for Season 8 I decided to pass my duties
of to someone else in our team, as I was getting tired of them.

Of course, with Blizzards ridiculous mismanagement of the game and especially its esports scene, my enthusiasm was
pretty much killed over night. Sad times.
