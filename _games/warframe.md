Digital Extremes tells me I created my Warframe account more than 10 years ago. I don't remember doing this.

I remember playing it a bit when it came out on the Switch. Then, with the release of Cross Save in 2023, I took that
as an incentive to try it again. Thanks to having made a friend that was very much into the game, this time
it stuck. After Destiny kept disappointing me, the story, gameplay and freedom, on what to do
in the game, was exactly what I wanted.

Also, Keith Power is an absolute genius! The music in Warframe is excellent, and way underdiscussed outside of the community.
