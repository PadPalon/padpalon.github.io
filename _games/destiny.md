For the last 3 years, Destiny 2 has been my thing. I love the gunplay, I love the world design and I absolutely adore the lore (Thanks Byf!).

I have spent a lot of time in this game. Recently, my brother got me an old Xbox One to also play the first Destiny, and it is awesome as well. I actually think some of the design aspects are even better than Destiny 2, but I still suck at console shooters, so there's some frustration while playing that game.

Having finally convinced enough friends to give it a try, I am now also slowly getting most of the raids in the game done.

**Update 2024**

With Bungie shitting the bed repeatedly, either by being asshole employers or taking baffling decisions in regards to their games, I have severly soured on Destiny.
My friends and myself did manage to do all raids and dungeons up until the release of Crota's End in Destiny 2 (although we never beat Crota). I finished
the campaign of The Final Shape (which was pretty good), and have since then played for a little bit. I hope they find their way, I will always love the Destiny universe,
but can't really consider myself a fan of the game or Bungie anymore.
