For the last 3 years, Destiny 2 has been my thing. I love the gunplay, I love the world design and I absolutely adore the lore (Thanks Byf!).

I have spent a lot of time in this game. Recently, my brother got me an old Xbox One to also play the first Destiny, and it is awesome as well. I actually think some of the design aspects are even better than Destiny 2, but I still suck at console shooters, so there's some frustration while playing that game.

Having finally convinced enough friends to give it a try, I am now also slowly getting most of the raids in the game done.
