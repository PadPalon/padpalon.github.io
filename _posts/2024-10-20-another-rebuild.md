Some years passed, so it's time to update the ol' website. How does the software engineer do that? Correct, he starts
with rebuilding how the develops and publishes the whole thing, because it pissed him off.

This blog is now running on Jekyll 4 and Minima 3, and it's all built in a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
My hope is this will make it easier to keep it updated and not result in another furious rebuild.

This, of course, means, that for you, nothing really changed visually, this is all for me.
I did update the content on the page thought, so maybe go enjoy that.
