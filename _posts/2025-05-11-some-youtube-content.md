Doing another one of these, because ... it's my blog and I want to get into writing and sharing more.

# [*Innuendo Studios*](https://www.youtube.com/@InnuendoStudios) by Ian Danskin

One of the most important political essay channels for the current age. [The Alt-Right Playbook](https://youtu.be/4xGawJIseNY?si=8NQQcJyD2gzo5Bmm)
is pretty much mandatory viewing if you're politically active or just present in online spaces, in my opinion.

At time of writing, Ian Danskin announced his indefinite hiatus due to financial reasons a few days ago. The fact that he can not make
a living, while producing such incredible essays, makes me very sad. The fact that his GoFundMe blew past his goal in a few hours, on the other hand,
makes me very happy. Go check him out, maybe consider joining his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/InnuendoStudios), since the GoFundMe is now closed.

# [*PROXIMATE - The Horror of Uncertainty*](https://youtu.be/D55fuKfEEG8) by Power Pak

Great video about a spooky game with a novel interface. I can listen to Power Pak exploring these dark mysteries endlessly, just great vibes.
Check out his [MyHouse.WAD](https://youtu.be/5wAo54DHDY0) video as well!

# [*Voices of the Void*](https://youtu.be/sFJ5LrDIzes) by deffy

This video game is super fascinating to me, but also something I could absolutely never play myself (I'm a huge scaredy-cat).
So I'm thankful I can just watch this fun exploration video instead.

# [*Project Nomads*](https://youtu.be/PoUYpNAa4gY) by Aztekhem

I gotta be honest, I have only skimmed this video before mentioning it here, but OH MY GOD SOMEONE ELSE REMEMBERS THIS GAME!!!

# [*The Haunted Facades and Liminal Spaces of Azeroth*](https://youtu.be/Qjj7a6eBFus) by Painticus

An older video that I've been obsessed with since my sibling got me to watch Painticus. Not his usual video topic,
but it feels like it was made for me specifically. Old Warcraft, creepy vibes, secrets, and the nostalgic and melancholic feelings running through it all.

# [*SardonicSays*](https://www.youtube.com/@SardonicSays)

Neat videos about more or less obscure videos and games. I've greatly enjoyed the two videos about [Earth 2150](https://youtu.be/NEe_0Z7klWE) and its sequal [Earth 2160](https://youtu.be/9NIq0fTgA2g), as well as another game I thought no one but me remembered, [Aquanox](https://youtu.be/SlYK84fCVoY).
