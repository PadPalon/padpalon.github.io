I want to share some YouTube content that I enjoyed recently. This is not necessarily newly released stuff, but they are new to me.
Links in the respective titles.

# [*For-Profit (Creative) Software*](https://youtu.be/I4mdMMu-3fc?si=zBJvrlJrSNPX7cKd) by EndVertex

Excellent video about the ever-worsening state of modern software and the subscription model. Fun animations.
The conclusions and thoughts on how to escape this environment are very important to me, as it is pretty much the intersection of most of my interests.

# [*Generative AI Is A Parasitic Cancer*](https://youtu.be/-opBifFfsMY?si=mBFu2-lStJSEb2Qy) by Freya Holm√©r & [*Google Doesn't Work Anymore*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_oAmo5hIQ) by Pinely

This topic is really coming to a head. I've been noticing it myself a lot these last few months when researching things for work or my game dev hobby,
so these two videos arrived at just the right time. Freya's video leans more towards the art / technical side, Pinely's is a bit more made for laughs,
but both are great watches. Special shoutout to Freya's outro, perfect writing that inspires in the face of terrible circumstances.

# [Angela Collier](https://www.youtube.com/@acollierastro/videos)

I'll give you some specific videos, but Angela Collier in general is just a great watch if you're interested in science, tech, but also the politics around those.

- [*the sham legacy of Richard Feynman*](https://youtu.be/TwKpj2ISQAc?si=76aw4JCBmZe9o9S9)
- [*billionaires want you to know they could have done physics*](https://youtu.be/GmJI6qIqURA?si=UrWtrsDl_Tg36R0V)
- [*who gets the Nobel prize?*](https://youtu.be/zS7sJJB7BUI?si=-9dlnqnPdjgMYUc1)

# [*The Zizians*](https://youtu.be/9mJAerUL-7w?si=sQWsITC-oNahHpWr) by Behind The Bastards

Absolutely insane group of people being profiled. I was confused, I facepalmed, I laughed, excellent work.

# [*To Kill The Sacred Worm*](https://youtu.be/6a8sARDI4VI?si=lA59udORIVP8HKTX) by Curious Archive

Well narrated video about chosen ones, scapegoats and how we tell stories about both.

# [*Is Fetish Art Important?*](https://youtu.be/AbRozm2Q-i8?si=UwdX7S-FmXyxdkiB) by Art Chad

Yeah, there's Sonic feet pics (and more) in this one. You'd think this video would be a big joke, but no, there's actually fascinating thoughts about
what art is (and can be) in this one.

# [*Why Are Creators Reviving The 4:3 Aspect Ratio?*](https://youtu.be/GBTc7eZ-Pyc?si=EXoS87uhuxVTdnyL) by Jam2go

Bit of history and discussion around aspect ratios. Not much to say about this one, it is what it says on the tin.
