A double update! What?! It is more likely than you think!

{% include toggle.html %}

<h3>Toggle</h3>

I've added a neat little script that allows me to define whole sections of a page that
a user can hide with a simple click. Try it out right here by clicking the text below!

<div class="toggle-enabled">
<p>Click me!</p>
<p>And I will vanish! ðŸ¥·</p>
</div>

This works everywhere on this page where you see that little minus or plus sign. No clue
if I wanna style it differently in the future, I kinda like it being this simple.

<h3>Tabletop</h3>

I've started a page about my tabletop hobby, from role playing games to strategy games to miniature painting.
It's very much a work-in-progress right now. Maybe you'll enjoy it anyway.

<h3>Oh my god a third update</h3>
I've adjusted the look of the page a bit.
