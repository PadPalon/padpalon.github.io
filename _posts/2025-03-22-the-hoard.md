I've removed the previous collections page that used to host my cd collection,
but was now just a link to my [RateYourMusic account](https://rateyourmusic.com/~PadPalon), and replaced it with The Hoardâ„¢.
I just want to have a place to share things that I find cool and interesting. Right now I'm thinking I'll do blog posts with the
actual contents, and then link those over there. We'll see how that goes.
