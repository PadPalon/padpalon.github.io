I see this album as a direct continuation of Discovery. It's a bit more polished, a bit more thought out and
a bit more well written (at least I hope so). I got to work with Gudi from Expellow (one of my favourite Swiss bands)
and it was a great experience. Having someone with experience and trained ears do the mixing and give some outside opinions
was so valuable. For the same reason, and because I have software engineer brain, I basically released my album in beta
to my friends to get some more feedback.

The album was released on February 1, 2024 on [Bandcamp](https://lucaneukom.bandcamp.com/album/horizons) and [Faircamp](https://music.padpalon.ch/neukom-horizons/).

*Conformity Discarded* from the album is partly intended as a theme song for my sibling, who was streaming on Twitch at that point.
This resulted in a funny little video for the song:
