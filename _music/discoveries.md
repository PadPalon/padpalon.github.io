A more focused project, I tried to write and produce a Synthwave EP. Working almost exclusively
with synthesizers instead of sampling was really cool. I think only the drums, the guitar in the last
song, and some sound effects are sampled. Another first was that I worked together with Mahmoud
Kattan at Mammoth Audio Engineering, who mixed and mastered my music. Check him out at [his website](https://www.mammothaudioengineering.com/).

The album, called **Discovery**, was released on November 1, 2020 on [Bandcamp](https://lucaneukom.bandcamp.com/album/discovery).
