Starting in mid-2018 I decided to start working on an album containing some of my songs and ideas
from the last few years. It will be a weird mix of atmospheric, electronic and orchestral songs,
all done completely by myself (read, pretty amateurish). It's something I always dreamed of
but only now seriously committed to, made plans and set deadlines to force me to actually
do some work. The album, called **Enigma I**, was released on May 1, 2019 on [Bandcamp](https://lucaneukom.bandcamp.com/releases).
