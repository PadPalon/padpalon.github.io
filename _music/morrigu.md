I've been playing guitar in the band **Morrigu** since 2016. You can find us on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/morriguofficial) or our
[website](http://www.morrigu.ch). There's also our
[Metal Archives](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Morrigu/14009) page as
well as our [Spotify artist page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5zO5rfvQXCyYIMCKMseZJt?si=WTCvfqnqSlaoqH5Oe-iGdw&nd=1).

Our newest album (and the first I was a part of) has been released on 23.04.2021. Here is a trailer for it.
