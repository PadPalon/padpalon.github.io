{% include toggle.html %}

My collection of things that I find coll and intersting, and would like to share. Music, articles, videos, any kind of project really.
I'll try to group these in some way, but this might very well become a mess quickly. As usual, a click on the header opens the contents.

<div class="toggle-enabled" data-toggled="false">
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<ul>
    {% include post_reference.html post="2025-03-23-favourite-youtube-content.md" %}
</ul>
</div>
