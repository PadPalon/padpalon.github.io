My name is Luca Neukom, although I go by the handle PadPalon or MellowMelon on
the internet. My pronouns are he/him.

## Programming

I've been using computers for a long, long time. I don't even remember for
certain when I started doing anything resembling coding. But my earliest
memories is getting a book from our local library called *Delphi for Dummies*
or something like that. I remember nothing about Delphi, but the interest in
coding and computers has stuck with me. You can find some of my projects over
on my [GitHub](https://github.com/PadPalon).

## Music

I've been making my own music for quite a few years now, be it on guitar or
entirely digital. Most of it has only ever been heard by me, but I have
released some of it over on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/padpalon).
There's my shitty beginnings, some fun ideas and a few clips I quite like. For
my proper releases, check out my [Bandcamp](https://lucaneukom.bandcamp.com/) or [Faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/).
I've also been active in a few bands and other projects, best go check those out over on [this
page]({{site.url}}/music).

## Gaming

I've been playing games for as long as I can remember, thanks to my parents. I
remember playing the original Sim City on a massive brick of a laptop. Well,
"playing" might be wrong word for it; I did not understand a single thing. But
I enjoyed myself and never stopped playing video games ever since. We did have
some Nintendo consoles (SNES, N64, GameCube, Wii) which I loved, but really
I've always been a PC gamer.

Additionally, I am a big fan of tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons or Stars
Without Number. At time of writing, I regularly play in one D&D group and am in
the process of starting a SWN group back up.

## Worldview

In several communities I frequent, there has been a growing sentiment of
"keeping politics out of whatever". I believe this to be nonsense, not only
because what counts as "politics" is often just an indication of what goes
against the status quo. In my mind, almost every facet of our lives are
constantly about "politics", either overtly or simply through the circumstances
we live and create in.

So, let me be clear about myself, so nobody thinks I am on "their side" simply
by default. I am a cishet white dude. I support the entire spectrum of gender,
sexuality and romantic interest. I see all people as deserving of respect and
equality, regardless of physical characteristics, creed or place of birth. On
this I will not budge. If you disagree, then *you are wrong*.

I see myself as a socialist. I keep on wanting to explore further and put my
ideology into words, but I get so tired of the world quickly. So let me blurt
out some simple single-sentence ideas to represent myself. From each according
to his ability, to each according to his needs. Unbound capitalism will be the
ruin of our world. Fuck fascists and their enablers.
