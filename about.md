My name is Luca Neukom, although I go by the handle PadPalon or MellowMelon on the internet.

I've been using computers for a long, long time. I don't even remember for certain when I
started
doing anything resembling coding. But my earliest memories is getting a book from our local
library
called *Delphi for Dummies* or something like that. I remember nothing about Delphi,
but the interest in coding and computers has stuck with me. You can find some of my projects
over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/PadPalon).

I've been making my own music for quite a few years now. Most of it has only ever been heard
by me. But I have released some of it over on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/padpalon).
There's my shitty beginnings, some fun ideas and a few clips I quite like. I'll curate some of
the better ones in the future.

I've been playing games for as long as I can remember, thanks to my parents. I remember playing
the original Sim City on a massive brick of a laptop. Well, "playing" might be wrong word for it;
I did not understand a single thing. But I enjoyed myself and never stopped playing video games
ever since. We did have some Nintendo consoles (SNES, N64, GameCube, Wii) which I loved, but really
I've always been a PC gamer.
